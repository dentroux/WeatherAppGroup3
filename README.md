WeatherApp for android, CS656 Group3

This is a hardcoded location that uses the API's city code for Newark, NJ.

Things to work on include
1. Getting location and getting the location's weather through the API
2. Possibilty of making a button to convert to metric? API is deg Fhrenheit  by default 
3. Getting the time
3. Currently gets the High and Lo temperatures for the day, not the actual temperature, something to work on
4. Rain/ precipitation percentages, not sure if this is in the API or not
5. Formatting the date (making it look nice)
6. Dealing with errors like no internet

Optional things that i can think of
1. Multiple day forecasts?
2. Adding pictures for the type of current weather?
3. Humidity?
4. Getting time instead of date?
